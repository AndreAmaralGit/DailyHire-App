# Dailyhire App

In this repository, you can find the Dailyhire Mobile Application. Dailyhire also has a Web Page and a Web Service allocated in the following repository: "https://github.com/AndreAmaralGit/Dailyhire-Web-Page-and-Web-Service". 

## Installation

Firstly, you need to get the files in the repository mentioned before and execute the installation process indicated. This will allow you to run all the functions in the App.

Some functions, use the Google Maps API, so if you want them to work you need to provide your own API key. The files in need of the API are: "Address.js", "AddressProfile.js" and "GooglePlaces.js".

After that, you will need a phone connected to your computer or a emulator, in which I use the Android Studio.

## Usage

```console
npm install

npm run android
```
